#🛡️ AI-Powered Phishing Detection and Analysis Tool

 ##📌 Description

This tool analyzes emails and URLs to detect phishing attempts using heuristic rules and signature-based detection. It helps reduce the risk of social engineering attacks by flagging suspicious content before users interact with it.

## 📦 Installation

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/phishing-detector.git
cd phishing-detector

   #### On Kali Linux / Debian-based Linux

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

  #### on windows

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/phishing-detector.git
cd phishing-detector
pip install -r requirements.txt


   #### Set your Groq API key
Create a .env file in the folder:
and accese the grock website link 
            https://groq.com/
and add like this on your api key
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
and save it as .env file 


        ▶️ Running the Application
On Kali Linux
python3 app.py

on windows
python app.py

now open browser and navigate 

    http://127.0.0.1:5000

 ##🔍 Key Features

- Email Analysis – Checks sender info, headers, and message content for phishing indicators.
- URL Scanning – Detects:
  - Typosquatting (e.g., g00gle.com)
  - Shortened/obfuscated links
  - Known phishing domains
- Heuristic Engine – Uses logic-based rules to detect suspicious behavior without relying on signatures alone.
- Signature Matching – Cross-references known phishing URLs from sources like PhishTank.
- IOC Extraction – Extracts indicators of compromise (IPs, domains, payload links).
- Modular Design – Can run standalone or plug into larger security pipelines.

 ##💡 Why It’s Different

Most phishing tools are heavy, API-dependent, or ignore local/regional threats. Ours is:

- Lightweight and fast 
- Customizable for specific phishing threats (e.g., local banks, telecom)
- Beginner-friendly but expandable for advanced use cases
- Designed for real-world training, not just detection

 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Regex and rule-based logic
- WHOIS and DNS lookups
- Public threat intel feeds (e.g., PhishTank, OpenPhish)

 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Machine learning phishing classifier (optional module)
- [ ] GUI for non-technical users
- [ ] Real-time scanning mode
- [ ] Email training simulations
